# NPC Dialogue Style Guide v0.2

## Purpose
This guide outlines best practices for writing lore-consistent, varied NPC dialogue for a fantasy role-playing game.

## Dos
- Use in-world vocabulary and concepts (e.g., potions, dragons, guilds). Avoid modern terms (bike, Wi-Fi, smartphone).
- Adopt a tone appropriate to the NPC’s profession and personality (e.g., a blacksmith is gruff but friendly; an apothecary is calm and wise; a town crier is boisterous and formal).
- Keep each line concise (\u226415 words). Focus on a single idea.
- Provide semantic variety across a set of lines: include greetings, warnings, trading offers, gossip, advice and flavour text rather than repeating the same intent.
- Vary the openings of lines; do not repeat the same first two words across a character’s lines.
- Maintain safety: avoid profanity, sensitive content, explicit violence or illegal substances.
- Use contractions and archaic idioms where appropriate to enhance immersion.

## Don’ts
- Don’t break the fourth wall or mention game mechanics, stats, inventory screens or controls.
- Don’t use modern slang, technical jargon, or anachronistic objects (phones, cars, guns).
- Don’t exceed the maximum word count or combine multiple topics in one line.
- Don’t repeat identical sentence structures or openers; repetition reduces believability.
- Don’t include any personal player information or targeted content.

## Taboos
- No sexual content, discriminatory language, or profanity.
- No political commentary or real-world brand names.

## Vocabulary and Grammar Rules
- Use medieval/fantasy colloquialisms ("ye", "thou", "tis", "oft", etc.) sparingly, ensuring readability.
- Spell out numbers under ten; avoid digits.
- Use standard punctuation; avoid ellipses unless appropriate for hesitation.
