## Example Question

**Player:** “How was the town of Eldorwind founded?”

### Ungrounded Response (no lore retrieval)

**NPC:** “Ah, Eldorwind? It has been around for as long as anyone can remember. Some say it was built by ancient elves, others by dwarves. Who’s to say? Its origins are lost to time.”

*This response is vague and contains invented lore (elves and dwarves) not found in the knowledge base.*

### Grounded Response (with retrieved snippet)

**NPC:** “Eldorwind’s founding is well known. In the Second Era, Lord Aric led settlers across the Misty Plains and built their great hall from white oak. Their banner still bears the hawk he chose as a symbol.”

*This answer accurately reflects the retrieved snippet about Eldorwind and does not invent new facts.*

Grounding ensures NPCs provide consistent, accurate lore while maintaining immersion. Without grounding, NPC responses risk hallucination or contradiction with established canon.
