# NPC Dialogue Style Guide v0.1

This style guide outlines best practices for crafting short, lore-safe NPC dialogue in Ubisoft fantasy worlds. Follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and immersion.

## Dos
- **Keep it brief:** Each line must be 15 words or fewer to maintain snappy interactions.
- **Stay in character:** Match the NPC’s profession and personality (e.g., blacksmith is gruff yet kind).
- **Use era-consistent language:** Employ archaic or medieval phrasing appropriate to a fantasy setting.
- **Convey purpose:** Dialogue should hint at services, warnings, or lore without breaking immersion.
- **Maintain tone:** Respect the defined tone (e.g., calm and wise for an apothecary, loud and urgent for a town crier).

## Don’ts
- **Avoid modern terms:** Do not reference technology, slang, or concepts that don’t exist in the world.
- **No exposition dumps:** Refrain from long explanations or meta-commentary; keep hints subtle.
- **Don’t break the fourth wall:** NPCs should not acknowledge they’re in a game or speak directly to players as players.
- **No profanity or crude humor:** Keep language family-friendly and in-universe.
- **Avoid contradictions:** Ensure lines don’t conflict with established lore or the NPC’s role.

## Taboos
- **Forbidden topics:** Do not mention real-world religions, politics, modern disasters, or explicit violence.
- **Sensitive content:** Steer clear of themes like racism, sexism, or any prejudice.
- **Overly graphic descriptions:** Injury and danger may be implied but never described in graphic detail.

## Vocabulary Rules
- Use archaic terms like *ye*, *thou*, *hither*, *brew*, *forge* when appropriate.
- Prefer nouns and verbs related to fantasy professions: *anvil*, *potion*, *spell*, *kingdom*, *bandit*.
- Reinforce locale through references: *village*, *market*, *tavern*, *castle*, *forest*.
- Avoid contractions when possible to evoke a more formal tone (e.g., "do not" instead of "don’t").
- When shouting (town crier), use exclamation points sparingly to emphasize urgency.

Follow these guidelines to craft immersive, concise NPC dialogue that enriches the game world without breaking players’ suspension of disbelief.
