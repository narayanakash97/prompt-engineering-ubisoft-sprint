# Quest Style Fit Notes (Test 01)

This report evaluates 10 generated quests for compliance with the project’s style guidelines.  Each quest consists of a title (≤ 6 words) and a brief (≤ 80 words) and is set in one of three eras—ancient, medieval, early‑industrial.  The content was checked for absence of clichés, modern slang, explicit content and intellectual‑property conflicts.

## Summary Table

| ID | Era | Title | Lengths OK? | Style Observations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Ancient | *Whispers of the Sundered Obelisk* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Inventive premise about a shattered obelisk. No “chosen one” trope or modern slang. Evokes mystery without referencing known IP. |
| **2** | Ancient | *Herald of the Hidden Oracle* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | The quest uses an ancient well and mechanical oracle; tone fits antiquity. Avoids cliché “prophecy saves the world.” |
| **3** | Ancient | *Bones Beneath the Jade Terrace* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | A burial site with traps and a restless architect is a fresh twist.  No violence beyond exploration; no explicit content. |
| **4** | Medieval | *The Miller’s Hidden Manuscript* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Medieval intrigue around a manuscript; no overused “rescue the princess” arcs.  Language is period‑appropriate. |
| **5** | Medieval | *Trial of the Forest Guard* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Investigation of lantern‑wielding bandits; explores responsibility without leaning on stock heroism.  Notes subtle moral choice. |
| **6** | Medieval | *Baron’s Fallow Orchard Mystery* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | The rotting fruit and chemical leak provide a grounded mystery.  Avoids magical clichés.  No modern references. |
| **7** | Early‑industrial | *Steamship to Embercliff Bay* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Steamship disappearance story evokes industrial revolution; no slang or IP, and the plot centres on smuggling rather than supernatural clichés. |
| **8** | Early‑industrial | *Mechanist’s Unfinished Symphony* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Inventor’s music engine is original; the word “symphony” stays within era.  The scenario is eerie without horror. |
| **9** | Early‑industrial | *Guild’s Clockwork Saboteur* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Focus on labour tensions and sabotage in a machine age; no clichés.  Tone suits early industry. |
| **10** | Early‑industrial | *Railway Under Siege* | ✅ title, ✅ brief | Railway sabotage and corporate rivalry are thematic for the era.  There are no modern idioms or IP references. |

## Overall Assessment

* **Titles:** All titles are six words or fewer and avoid generic formulas (“The Lost … of …”). They evoke specific objects or situations without referencing copyrighted properties.
* **Briefs:** Each summary is under 80 words and avoids modern slang.  The language remains era‑appropriate—no mention of “robots” in ancient quests or “cyber” terms in industrial ones.
* **Content Filters:** None of the quests contain explicit violence or sexual content.  Plots revolve around investigation, exploration and social dynamics rather than hero clichés.  No well‑known fantasy IPs (e.g., Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons) are referenced.
* **Era Distribution:** The quests are evenly distributed: three ancient, three medieval and four early‑industrial stories.  This provides a balanced variety of settings and themes.

These quests comply with the stated constraints and could be used as seed content for a narrative generation system.
